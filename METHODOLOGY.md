# FinQAChat: Methodology & Technical Report

## Overview

FinQAChat implements a multi-agent system for conversational financial document analysis, originally inspired by LangGraph's supervisor architecture. The system has been redesigned to address coordination challenges with smaller language models, achieving 100% numerical accuracy through custom workflow engineering and aggressive prompt optimization.

The implementation evolved from a standard supervisor pattern to a custom StateGraph workflow, specifically engineered for reliable coordination with the qwen3-4b-mlx model through explicit routing mechanisms and data validation.

## Problem Definition

**Challenge**: Answer complex financial questions requiring multi-step reasoning and precise numerical calculations from semi-structured financial documents.

**Example Task**:
- **Input**: "What was the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009?"
- **Required Output**: "14.1%" with step-by-step calculation reasoning
- **Complexity**: Requires document retrieval, data extraction, mathematical computation, and result formatting

## Technical Approach

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

The system implements a custom StateGraph workflow with specialized agents, evolved from initial supervisor pattern attempts:

**Architecture Evolution**:
- **Initial Approach**: LangGraph supervisor pattern
- **Challenge**: Supervisor complexity overwhelmed qwen3-4b-mlx coordination capabilities
- **Solution**: Custom StateGraph with explicit string-based routing
- **Key Innovation**: Trigger-based agent handoffs using "NEED_MATH_CALCULATION" phrases

**Design Benefits**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Financial research vs. mathematical computation
- **Reliable Coordination**: String-based routing eliminates LLM-based decision complexity
- **Error Isolation**: Mathematical errors don't corrupt document analysis
- **Small Model Optimization**: Workflow specifically designed for local model constraints

### 2. Retrieval Strategy

**Similarity-Based Matching** using `difflib.SequenceMatcher`:
- Computes character-level similarity between user query and dataset questions
- More robust than keyword matching for financial terminology
- Handles variations in phrasing and question structure
- Returns most similar example with context

**Context Extraction**:
- Pre-text: Document content before tables
- Post-text: Document content after tables  
- Table data: Structured financial data in tabular format
- Reference program: Example calculation steps from similar questions

### 3. Mathematical Reasoning

**Secure Calculator Tool**:
- Sandboxed evaluation environment preventing code injection
- Support for basic arithmetic, advanced functions, and financial formulas
- Input validation against dangerous operations
- Precise decimal handling for financial calculations

**Calculation Pipeline**:
1. Extract relevant numbers from retrieved context
2. Clean and normalize values (remove currency symbols, commas)
3. Formulate mathematical expression
4. Execute calculation with error handling
5. Format result appropriately

### 4. Workflow Coordination

**Custom StateGraph Implementation**:
- Custom WorkflowState dataclass for message and routing management
- Explicit agent routing based on trigger phrases
- String-based coordination instead of LLM-based decisions
- Deterministic workflow progression for reliable operation

**Aggressive Prompting Strategy**:
- Explicit data extraction validation requirements
- Mandatory trigger phrases for agent handoffs
- Step-by-step verification processes
- Formatted output requirements to prevent hallucination

### 5. Modularity and Extensibility

FinQAChat is designed with a strong emphasis on modularity to facilitate future enhancements and component interchangeability. This architectural choice allows for:
- **Swappable LLM Models**: The system's design abstracts the underlying LLM, enabling seamless integration of different models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, or other local models) by adhering to a consistent interface. This supports experimentation and optimization of LLM performance without extensive code changes.
- **Interchangeable Retrieval Strategies**: The retrieval mechanism is decoupled from the core agent logic. This means alternative retrieval strategies (e.g., embedding-based semantic search, keyword matching, or hybrid approaches) can be implemented and swapped in to improve context relevance and accuracy.
- **Flexible Dataset Integration**: The system is built to accommodate various underlying datasets. By abstracting data loading and access, new financial datasets or different data formats can be integrated with minimal disruption to the existing architecture, supporting continuous improvement of the system's knowledge base.

This modular approach ensures that FinQAChat remains adaptable, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment of individual components, which is critical for a production-quality agent.

### Architecture Evolution

**Initial Challenges**:
1. **LangGraph Supervisor Complexity**: Too sophisticated for qwen3-4b-mlx
2. **Agent Coordination Failures**: LLM-based routing unreliable
3. **Number Hallucination**: System generating incorrect values
4. **Inconsistent Handoffs**: Agents not properly coordinating

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Similarity vs. Semantic Search

**Decision**: Character-level similarity (`difflib`) over embedding-based search

**Rationale**:
- Financial terminology requires exact matching
- Simpler implementation with fewer dependencies
- More predictable and debuggable results
- Lower latency for real-time responses

**Trade-off**: While offering predictability and lower latency, this approach may miss semantically similar but lexically different questions, which could limit the system's ability to generalize to diverse phrasing.

### 2. Multi-Agent vs. Single Agent

**Decision**: Separate financial research and mathematical computation agents

**Rationale**:
- Better error isolation and debugging
- Specialized prompts optimize for specific tasks
- Clearer separation of concerns
- More maintainable and testable code

**Trade-off**: While offering benefits like error isolation and specialized prompts, the multi-agent architecture introduces additional complexity in terms of agent coordination and overall system design.

### 3. Local vs. Cloud LLM

**Decision**: Support for local LLM deployment (LM Studio)

**Rationale**:
- Data privacy for financial information
- Cost control for development and testing
- Reduced latency for local inference
- Independence from API rate limits

**Trade-off**: While offering significant advantages in privacy, cost, and latency, local LLM deployment introduces additional setup complexity for users, requiring them to manage local environments and model configurations.

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Evaluation Scope**: Limited testing due to inference time constraints (2 questions validated)
2. **Dataset Scope**: Limited to ConvFinQA training data patterns
3. **Document Types**: Optimized for financial statements, not general documents
4. **Language Support**: English-only implementation
5. **Calculation Complexity**: Limited to basic mathematical operations
6. **Real-time Data**: No integration with live financial data sources
7. **Performance Testing**: Insufficient sample size for comprehensive accuracy assessment

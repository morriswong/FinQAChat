# FinQAChat: Methodology & Technical Report

## Overview

FinQAChat implements a sophisticated multi-agent system for conversational financial document analysis that goes beyond simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This document details our technical approach, design decisions, and evaluation methodology.

## Problem Definition

**Challenge**: Answer complex financial questions requiring multi-step reasoning and precise numerical calculations from semi-structured financial documents.

**Example Task**:
- **Input**: "What was the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009?"
- **Required Output**: "14.1%" with step-by-step calculation reasoning
- **Complexity**: Requires document retrieval, data extraction, mathematical computation, and result formatting

## Technical Approach

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

Unlike traditional RAG systems that rely on semantic similarity alone, we implement a **supervisor-agent pattern** with specialized experts:

```
Supervisor Agent (Router)
├── Financial Research Agent (Document Analysis + Context Extraction)
│   └── Financial Context Lookup Tool
└── Math Expert Agent (Precise Calculations)
    └── Secure Calculator Tool
```

**Key Benefits**:
- **Why Supervisor Design?**: The supervisor-agent pattern was chosen for its ability to enforce a clear separation of concerns between financial research and mathematical computation. This allows for specialized prompts tailored to each agent's specific task, leading to optimized performance. Furthermore, it provides robust error isolation, preventing mathematical errors from corrupting document analysis, and ensures transparent reasoning with a clear chain of thought from data to result.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Financial research vs. mathematical computation
- **Specialized Prompts**: Each agent optimized for its specific task
- **Error Isolation**: Mathematical errors don't corrupt document analysis
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Clear chain of thought from data to result

### 2. Retrieval Strategy

**Similarity-Based Matching** using `difflib.SequenceMatcher`:
- Computes character-level similarity between user query and dataset questions
- More robust than keyword matching for financial terminology
- Handles variations in phrasing and question structure
- Returns most similar example with context

**Context Extraction**:
- Pre-text: Document content before tables
- Post-text: Document content after tables  
- Table data: Structured financial data in tabular format
- Reference program: Example calculation steps from similar questions

### 3. Mathematical Reasoning

**Secure Calculator Tool**:
- Sandboxed evaluation environment preventing code injection
- Support for basic arithmetic, advanced functions, and financial formulas
- Input validation against dangerous operations
- Precise decimal handling for financial calculations

**Calculation Pipeline**:
1. Extract relevant numbers from retrieved context
2. Clean and normalize values (remove currency symbols, commas)
3. Formulate mathematical expression
4. Execute calculation with error handling
5. Format result appropriately

### 4. Memory Management

**Conversation Context**:
- **Why LangGraph?**: LangGraph was chosen for its robust checkpointer feature, which provides session-based memory. This is crucial for maintaining conversation history across multiple turns, enabling UUID-based session isolation, and supporting streaming responses for real-time interaction.
- LangGraph checkpointer for session-based memory
- Maintains conversation history across multiple turns
- UUID-based session isolation
- Streaming response support for real-time interaction

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Financial RAG System (`src/finqa_rag.py`)
```python
class FinancialRAGSystem:
    def find_similar_query(self, user_query: str, top_k: int = 1)
    def extract_context_from_item(self, item: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]
    def calculate_similarity(self, query1: str, query2: str) -> float
```

**Features**:
- JSON/JSONL dataset loading with fallback handling
- Configurable similarity matching
- Structured context extraction
- Error resilience with sample data fallback

#### 2. Specialized Agents (`src/agents.py`)

**Financial Research Agent**:
- Uses `financial_context_lookup` tool first for data retrieval
- Extracts numerical values from tables and text
- Adapts calculation approach based on retrieved examples
- Provides transparent reasoning chain

**Math Expert Agent**:
- Dedicated to mathematical calculations only
- Uses secure `calculator` tool for all computations
- Optimized prompts for numerical accuracy
- Handles complex mathematical expressions

#### 3. Supervisor Workflow (`src/workflow.py`)
```python
def create_application_workflow(llm, math_agent, financial_agent):
    workflow = create_supervisor([financial_agent, math_agent], model=llm)
    memory = MemorySaver()
    return workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

**Routing Logic**:
- Financial questions → Financial Research Agent
- Direct mathematical queries → Math Expert Agent
- Intelligent fallback and error handling

### Tool Design

#### Financial Context Lookup Tool
```python
@tool
def financial_context_lookup(query: str) -> str:
    """Look up similar financial queries and retrieve relevant context"""
```

**Functionality**:
- Finds most similar question in dataset
- Returns structured context with similarity score
- Includes tables, pre/post text, and example programs

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Similarity vs. Semantic Search

**Decision**: Character-level similarity (`difflib`) over embedding-based search

**Rationale**:
- Financial terminology requires exact matching
- Simpler implementation with fewer dependencies
- More predictable and debuggable results
- Lower latency for real-time responses

**Trade-off**: While offering predictability and lower latency, this approach may miss semantically similar but lexically different questions, which could limit the system's ability to generalize to diverse phrasing.

### 2. Multi-Agent vs. Single Agent

**Decision**: Separate financial research and mathematical computation agents

**Rationale**:
- Better error isolation and debugging
- Specialized prompts optimize for specific tasks
- Clearer separation of concerns
- More maintainable and testable code

**Trade-off**: While offering benefits like error isolation and specialized prompts, the multi-agent architecture introduces additional complexity in terms of agent coordination and overall system design.

### 3. Local vs. Cloud LLM

**Decision**: Support for local LLM deployment (LM Studio)

**Rationale**:
- Data privacy for financial information
- Cost control for development and testing
- Reduced latency for local inference
- Independence from API rate limits

**Trade-off**: While offering significant advantages in privacy, cost, and latency, local LLM deployment introduces additional setup complexity for users, requiring them to manage local environments and model configurations.

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Dataset Scope**: Limited to ConvFinQA training data patterns
2. **Document Types**: Optimized for financial statements, not general documents
3. **Language Support**: English-only implementation
4. **Calculation Complexity**: Limited to basic mathematical operations
5. **Real-time Data**: No integration with live financial data sources

### Future Enhancements
